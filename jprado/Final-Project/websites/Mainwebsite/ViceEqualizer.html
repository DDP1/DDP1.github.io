		<h2>
			My Duty as Vice Equalizer
		</h2>

		<p>
			As a Vice Equalizer my duty is to talk for Javier in meetings if he is not able to make it, do any tasks I am given, and of course to balance the teams. The reason I got hired as a Vice Equalizer is due to the fact that we are expecting a very big population for the League of Legends Tournament. That means that there is a lot more people to study and place into fair teams. This can't all be done by one man so I thought I'd do half the work when the time comes. If there is another person balancing the teams there won't be any bias or cheating involved with the balancing.
