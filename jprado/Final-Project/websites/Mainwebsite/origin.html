			<h2>
				Why the name Equalizer?
			</h2>

			<p>
				The name Equalizer was originally made by Josh, our Vice President of the Club. At first it was just a name that sounded fitting to being a team balancer but it became much more. One day I was playing League of Legends as Rumble, my favorite character. He's a strong late game champion due to his large area of effect ultimate. I was about to use his ultimate when I noticed something; his ultimate's name had the same name as me; "The Equalizer". This was merely a coincidence, but an amazing one nonetheless.

			<h2>
				Who is Rumble?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Rumble is from the League of Legends universe. In the game there are different cities and cultures that the characters come from. Rumble is a Yordle which makes him tiny by most standards but even worse he was the runt of the litter making him insanely tiny. Rumble's hobby is tinkering with scraps from the junkyard. He is a lone rebel who left Bandle City in order to get away from others. However he came back to Bandle City in a giant mechanized monstrosity in order to join League of Legends and prove to the rest of the world what Yordle technology was capable of. You can see the full lore <a href="http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/rumble/#champion-lore" target="_blank">here.</a>

			<h2>
				Rumble's Ultimate, The Equalizer
			</h2>

			<p>
				Rumble's Ultimate is almost game breaking. It's what makes him the most underplayed, yet powerful champion in the game. The Ultimate is hard to land but if you can get a full enemy team in it's area of effect, it will completly change a team fight. I guess the reason it's called The Equalizer is because no matter how far ahead the enemy team is, it can balance a team fight. Rumble's Ultimate can be seen below.
