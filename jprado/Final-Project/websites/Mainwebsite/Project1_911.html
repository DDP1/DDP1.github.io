			Hello! I am Javier Prado the Equalizer of Franklin High School's League of Legends Club! As the Equalizer of the club my job is to balance a team of 5 people so that they will be fair to play against. The way I got the name Equalizer is because first of all it represents my position very well and it is the name of one of my favorite character's ultimate in League of Legends. Here on my Equalizer website you will be able to view the teams that will be participating in the tournament. If you are here as a player you can see who is on your team the day that it is released and get their names so you can add them onto your friends list via League of Legends. Good luck and have fun!

		<h2>
			League for Franklin
		</h2>

		<p>
			League for Franklin is the name of our club. It occurs every friday after school in room 121, otherwise known as the old choir room. It goes from 3:20 pm to 5:40 pm. When you come to our club you are not required to bring your computer to play League of Legends because the very kind Mr. Perez allowed us to use the new school macs in order to play! They get 60 FPS at full graphics. The only problem is the mice attached to the computers have a hard time right clicking so you are allowed to bring your own mice or keyboards if you'd like. At 5:00 pm there is a final call for starting games. Starting a game beyond that point must be cancelled. Usually most people start clearing out by then. Most Fridays are just skirmishes to come hang out and play, but starting November 7th there will be tournament of 5 v 5s.

		<h2>
			Tournaments
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			The way the tournaments work is you can sign up 2 weeks before the tournament to be entered into it. To enter the tournament and play it costs $5, to spectate it costs $1 and to spectate using one of the empty macs it costs an extra $2 charge to players or spectators. You will be put into a balanced team to make the tournament more fair with players you may or may not know. I personally recommend practicing with those players so you can be ready for the tournament and meet new people. When you lose a game or win you will be put into a different bracket against a different team. The losers bracket will not be spectated on the big screen but it can be spectated by the people who paid the extra $2 fee to use a mac. If you win enough games in the losers bracket you could be promoted back into the winners bracket because everyone deserves a second chance. If someone on your team doesn't show up then a substitute can be elected by the Equalizers for a fair match.

		<h2>
			How Team Balancing is Done
		</h2>

		<p>
			Last year we had our first game in the League of Legends club. I currently was just a player and had no position in the staff. I decided that to know the enemy I would do research on each player finding out their ranks, games played, and skill. I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wSr5AQDpExIAe2R5zRPxpfHc2qy9Qv9WqH7ADUTYLQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Docs Chart</a> that was only accessible to my teammates. Eventually after the tournament was finished my chart had shared itself around and it was shown that I had some expertise for studying teams. I knew who's team was unbalanced and who's team was too balanced and we didn't have to stress about. This of course secured my position for team balancing when asked who would fill the roll. It was pretty obvious the best decision would be for me to do it.

		<h2>
			My Personal Interests
		</h2>

		<p>
			As you can probably guess I'm a really big gamer. Most gamers focus on one to five games that they spend most of their time on but I feel more experienced with all different types of games. Chance is if you mention a game I've probably played or seen it be played on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. The three main games that I nerd over and waste multiple days of time on are <a href="http://blog.dota2.com/" target="_blank">Dota 2,</a><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank"> League of Legends,</a><a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/" target="_blank"> and Counter Strike GO.</a> I have 718 hours on Dota 2, around 350 hours on League of Legends, and 91 hours of Counter Strike GO. You can see my Steam Profile <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024983595" target="_blank">here</a>.

			Goodbye, for now!

		<p>
			This website may be done for the current outline but it isn't done all together. I plan to make this the main website people go to in order to see their teams, find resources, and meet each other.
