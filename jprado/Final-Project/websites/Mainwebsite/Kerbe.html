	<p>I am a 16 year old artist that works on Techno music as a hobby. My music is refered to as scrolling music as there isn't any heavy drops (most of the time) but is very good for listening to when surfing the web, studying for school, or just multitasking in general. Kirby has always been my favorite videogame character ever since childhood and to this day I still enjoy the franchise. Most of my gamertags include Kirby in the name which is no big harm but I was afraid if I made my artist name with the exact spelling of a videogame character I might be sued by Nintendo. So instead I decided to make it a different spelling with the same pronounciation.</p>
