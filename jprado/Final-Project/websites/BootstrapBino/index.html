              More recently, Glover has stayed out of the public eye, choosing to remain relatively silent even as his profile and popularity have skyrocketed. He’s become a legitimate star, but he’s less openly self-promotional than ever. His main method of communicating with the public recently has been his music videos, of which he has released five in the last 15 months. The videos for “The Worst Guys”, “3005”, “Sweatpants”, “Telegraph Ave.” and “Sober” border on short films at times, and they have taken viewers into worlds filled with time eddies, horrifying tentacle monsters, and suspiciously empty diners.

              Anybody who has been familiar with Gambino for even a couple of hours knows that his history with his blackness is complicated. The incidents he’s rapped about before aren’t too far away from ones that I’ve also dealt with at different times growing up. That reminder that somehow you aren't black black like the other kids who go through the same things you do and are somehow inferior for it. You don't fit into any of the typical stereotypes and are made to feel inadequate for this failure, despite still being subjected to the same treatment.

              That’s what the monster in the videos is telling us. There is a whale in the series that acts as a looming threat throughout. Its attack on Glover is the catalyst behind the story, and its effect on him is what drives the plot forward. The appearance of the monster is symbolic, as whales are often associated with cognizance, emotional maturity, and deep wisdom—all overriding themes of the videos. The videos are an investigation into perspective shifts, unwarranted aggressions, and the lack of real progression in how society deals with race as a whole.
