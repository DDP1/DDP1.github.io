			<p>
			Strings are used for manipulating and sorting text. Numbers are used for data values. JavaScript variables are storage for data values. By using spacing in JavaScript you are able to use different keywords in one line of code. What I learned today was how to use buttons in JavaScript.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">			
			<h3>2/24/2015</h3>

			<p>
			We learned about arrays and how to use the information that the user enters into a prompt into an alert.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>2/26/2015</h3>

			<p>
			I'm currently working on the loop challenge having a terrible time trying to figure out what to do with countless google searches.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/2/2015</h3>

			<p>
			We worked on a cheat sheet that I already knew most of.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/3/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Finished the loop project but I still feel pretty lost. Need help.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/5/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Finally learned how to do loops #thanksjamieson.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/10/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Having trouble learning how to make buttons activate loops, only can find them activating functions.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/12/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Still having a lot of trouble with buttons and how to make them activate lines in javascript. Really stressful, the more google sites I use the more confused I get. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/16/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Trying to use the onclick function in the button to activate Javascript. It doesn't seem to work and I'm not sure if it's because it just doesn't work or if the actual java function it's activating is broken.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/17/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Found out the onclick function was not needed. Instead I saw Mr. Jamieson's code and found out all I needed was an event listener that would start a function. Inside the function I placed the loop and it all worked out! The next steps are making on of those loops a while loop and also figuring out how to hide and show pictures.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>3/31/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Finished my project and am now working on a Javascript Rock Paper Scissors game. Using If and Else variables to work out functions that are based on the user's input. It should be hard but not too hard hopefully. Wish me luck.
			</p>
		</div>

			OK ALEX LISTEN HERE I MADE A JOURNAL AND IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU. Today Alex learned Marquee, it was very interesting because it took him 1 whole hour to learn it, what a scrublord. His site is not near to completion because he spent so much time on scrollamount="". However my site is completly finished in style and is ready to be javascripted. GG ALEXZ

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>4/7/2015</h3>

			<p>
			I finished a rock paper scissors Javascript challenge. I thought it was going to be difficult but it turned out not to be too bad. Now I understand if else statements and also how for Javascript to check 2 elements before moving on
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>4/9/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Scrolled through the Bootstrap site finding different elements it has to offer. Turns out I can't scroll through it however if I'm going to completly redesign a site using it. I will choose a different website to redesign with Bootstrap and preferably create a new one to get a hang of it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>4/14/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Looked through professional websites to find elements that I would like to implement in my own. Then got onto bootstrap to make a website that's mobile resposive. Learned so far how to use grids and make images responsive. The three webpages I planned to use were <a href="http://borderlandsthegame.com//">Borderlands</a>, <a href="http://www.foodbeast.com/">Food Beast</a>, and <a href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/?-">Heroes of the Storm</a>.

		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>4/21/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Today we made a github account so that we can use it for future websites. We are also now implementing boothub into our rock paper scissors website. Things are starting to get a little complicated and I could use some help from the teacher.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>4/23/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Today we made our Rock, Paper, Scissors website into a bootstrap website. It is now responsive with Mobile devices.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>5/4/2015</h3>

			<p>
			I finished up my Rock Paper Scissors website to be responsive with Bootstrap and then I learned how to use GitHub to upload it to the cloud.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>5/18/2015</h3>

			<p>
			I implemented some forms into my home page. It included a check box, fill out, and target points. Philip jhonson talked a lot about semen and it was kinda weird but enjoyable at the same time. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>5/19/2015</h3>

			<p>
			Worked on pictures, still can't figure out how to make the pictures become different sizes based on the window, img responsive doesn't seem to work well in desktop, only good in mobile. Bootstrap seems to be more of a bother than a success.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journaldivs">
			<h3>5/21/2015</h3>

			<p>
			After a lot of bugs and hard work I finally got the forms working. The pictures are also formatted properly in a grid. So far so good. Next class I will work on making the Check Box submit text.
