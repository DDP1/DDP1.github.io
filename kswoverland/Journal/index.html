    <p>A string is a short series of characters that is inside double quotes "John Doe" or two single quotes 'John Doe'</p>
    <p>A variable is represented by "var" which can be designed like containers for storing data values.</p>
    <p>Numbers are variable values that can be used for mutliple things suchs as calculating, storing, and represent quantities of things.</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"><h4>Monday, February 23rd 2015</h4>
    <p>Today I caught up on most assignments. I completed my first journal entry and fixed some mistakes on the review project that Mr. Jamieson told me to fix.</p></div>
</div>
			
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Tuesday, February 24rd 2015</h4>
    <p>Today I completed the array introduction and started on the challenge.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Thursday, February 26rd 2015</h4>
    <p>I completed the array challenged and watched all of the screen casts. I started my loop activity as well.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Monday, March 2nd 2015</h4>
    <p>Today we created our cheat sheet in which we defined the function of different types of of JavaScript code that includes variables, arrays, messages, prompts, and rounding up or down by using floor or ceil.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"><h4>Tuesday, March 3rd 2015</h4>
    <p>We went over a drill that explained to the class what a variable was and three different ways we can use it. We also went over in class what a push, pop, unshift, and shift does. Push adds a value to the end of a last. Unshift adds a value to the beginning of a list. Pop removes the value form the endo of the list and shift removes the value from the beginning of the list. After that we worked on experimenting with the "while" loop to see how we can use these things.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Thursday, March 5th 2015</h4>
    <p>We went over for and while loops learning how to use them and when to use them. We did both a drill and group challenge that allowed us to explore ourselves how these types of JavaScript code can actually be used.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5">  <h4>Monday, March 9th 2015</h4>
    <p>We reviewed the rubric for the JavaScript 1 project and the guidelines for what to include.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5">  <h4>Tuesday, March 10th 2015</h4>
    <p>We started our JavaScript Project 1 with a subsitute. I worked on creating my HTML and my design I wanted for the project, edited the CSS, and started making a for loop on my JavaScript file.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Thursday, March 12th 2015</h4>
    <p>We continued to work on our javascript projects while Mr. Jamieson went around the room checking our web journals, and our notebooks. I completed the foundation for my project and now I just need to include the needed scripts for maximum points.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"><h4>Monday, March 15th 2015</h4>
    <p>Today I worked on my project some more planning on what I want to add during the week.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5">   <h4>Thursday, March 19th 2015</h4>
    <p>Today I worked on my Phil Dye the Tye Dye Guy website. I added some for loops and I changed the background color to tansition into different colors through css from a source I found online. I plan to complete my while loop next class.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Monday, March 24th 2015</h4>
    <p>My while loop is complete and I am mostly complete with my JavaScript project. I added some pictures and made some divs that pop up in the color of your entry when you were prompt when changed to the dye part of the website.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"><h4>Thursday, April 9th 2015</h4>
    <p>Rock Paper Scissors is complete! I completed last class but this class I enhanced it and allowed a picture and the choice selection of the opponent to show up when you choose your own choice for more visual appeal.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5">  <h4>April 13, 2015</h4>
  <p>We worked some more on our Rock Paper Scissors website even though I completed it already. I added some more to it. I enhanced the interativity and I also created a text that shows up in the middle of the screen that tells you if you win, lose, or tie.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5">  <h4>Tuesday, April 14, 2015</h4>
    <p>In class today we explored many websites through one website called awwwards. We looked at three different websites that we like and recorded them down on paper.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>Thursday, April 16, 2015</h4>
    <p>Last class we were exploring websites and I have found three different websites that interested me in its design, user interactivity, and it layout. The first website I liked is <a href="http://brewsters.ca">Brewsters</a> because it has a great color scheme, and an awesome navigation. The second website, my favorite, is <a href="http://www.species-in-pieces.com/#">Species in Pieces.</a> This website has great designs. Each species is made up of parts and they all transition well into another species when broken up into parts again. All around cool. The last website that I found interesting is <a href="http://kurokawawonderland.jp/">Hurokawa Wonderland</a>. It's pretty basic but really interative. There is a side bar that allows you to navigate though the website which is really nice and then the big section of the website has a good interactive map. Most of these websites that I like are the most interactive websites. So I plan to create as much user interactivity when creating something of my own. There wasn't much that I didn't like. Some websites, like Species in Pieces had a whole bunch of design and didn't include much info on each species. If they added more content and displayed it well then the website would be even greater. There is no area of the website that tells you how to help these endangered species. Brewsters was simple. A little too simple. Maybe more interactivity? and Hurokawa could have some better buttons because some were rather hard to click.</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"><h4>Thursday, April 30, 2015</h4>
    <p>Today we had an alright sub. Told Jason off. I worked on styling my journal and my rock paper scissors so it looks more "modern" and sync'd it to GitHub.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5">  <h4>May 4th, 2015</h4>
  <p>Over the weekened I did a major update to my RPS project to make it look better when you have it full screen and in mobile size as well as formating it so everything is centered. In class I accidentally delteted my web journal and I re made it because I dun-goofed.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"><h4>May 5th, 2015</h4>
    <p>I added some hover aspects to my rock paper scissors, added an enemy scoring system, and then I made a navigation bar linking my Rock Paper Scissors, Grid Project, and my Journal all together and making a home page while at it.</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4> May 11th, 2015</h4>
      <p>This Monday we received our rubric for the end of the year project and an example on moodle. Seniors have a different due date than other lower classmen. I have to add an ABOUT ME in my home page and add pictures to it as well. As for everything else, it's fine. I might just need to change the styling a little bit to make it more professional looking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>May 18th, 2015</h4>
      <p> This Monday I focused a lot of time added the required aspects of my final project to my work. I edited my navigation bar and I added a 2nd form, which is required, which is a checkbox that writes HTML code when you select an answer and checks the box for you if you choose yes or no.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4> May 19th, 2015</h4>
      <p>Today I completed my Project with all the required aspects to it. I styled the navigation bar a little better, updated my biography, and changed the pictures to make it more apporpriate to "About Me". After that we learned what DOM is, which is a structure that other programs use, like JavaScript, to navigate through your HTML to do something to it like creating a program.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="col-md-2 cold-xs-2"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 col-xs-5"> <h4>May 21st, 2015</h4>
      <p>Today I spent a lot of time trying to get multiple inputs in one form and failed to write it to the webpage via getElementById.innerHTML.... I am pretty much complete with the entire project though and almost ready to turn it in.
