					<h2>17 February</h2>
					<p>
						Today I learned more about the application and usefulness of arrays. They are a collection of data points called <i>elements</i>. I used them to make a JavaScript program for changing the background color of and HTML page to a random color within the RGB color range. To do this, I used the random generation process:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Generate an array of 3 random elements</li>
						<li>Convert the array into RGB format</li>
						<li>Output the RGB color to the background of the HTML page</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>2 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today we created JavaScript cheat sheets for use in the future. The sheets detailed what we needed to know as far as basic commands that would be frequented in making programs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>3 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today the focus was on array methods, namely push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift(). The methods perform the following actions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>shift(): erases array elements from the end</li>
						<li>unshift(): adds array elements to the end</li>
						<li>pop(): erases elements from the beginning</li>
						<li>push(): adds elements to beginning of array</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>10 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today we started work on the newest project, a comprehensive JavaScript program. Mine is a Web site to guess at a randomly chosen number. The Web page will change the background color to a hot or cold color depending on how far away your guess is.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>12 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today I continued development of my JavaScript program, making the code work in theory. The page is caught in a perpetual loop because of a while loop that never ends. I will need to fix it next time.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>16 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today I woked on my comprehensive JavaScript project. I got the background color to fade to different hues depending on how far away the number guessed was from a number randomly generated. The colors are reversed, though. It turns blue when closer to a value and red when farther away. I will fix this in the future.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>17 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today I continued to work on the JavaScript that drives the color changing game. The actual mechanism by which the color fades was resolved. The problem was that the number was not floored properly. The color reversal was also fixed.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>19 March</h2>
					<p>
						Continuing my goal to make the JavaScript page work, the page is effectively done. Added in is the pages's ability to show all of the attempts leading up to guessing the correct number. The project is ready to be submitted.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>30 March</h2>
					<p>
						Today I showed off the finished product of the comprehensive JavaScript project assignment. It correctly makes the pseudorandom number, then entertains guesses from the users of the program. I also started reading about Bootstrap and how it can be used to make more professional Web sites.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>7 April</h2>
					<p>
						Today I began work on my rock paper scissors project.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>9 April</h2>
					<p>
						Today the rock paper scissors program finally works. The program has the ability to generate a random number, then display the results of the randomized match against the player. I will later add more functionality to the code.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>13 April</h2>
					<p>
						Today I further worked on the rock paper scissors challenge. It was already fully functional, though I added some more style and organization. Rock and paper have images associated with the buttons.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>14 April</h2>
					<p>
						Today I explored bootstrap and started working on a basic netsite that uses a coordinate system to keep track of where div's should appear on the screen. The grid system works and downsizes div's when the window of the browser is downsized.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">

						Last class, I looked at three Web sites, viewing their strengths and weaknesses. I chose the following sites to view.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b><a href="http://www.timeshift165.com/">Timeshift 165</a><br></b>
							<i>Strengths:</i> The website's most prominent feature is the interative game that features the car that is being promoted. The game is fairly minimal in terms of playability, but it still goes above and beyond in terms of advertising. It also has a very modern design that is simple to look at and feels uncluttered.<br>
							<i>Weaknesses:</i> The interactivity with the web site is fairly minimal. Though the game is really interesting and cool, the controls are fairly strange. The site also does not work well under a slow internet connection.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b><a href="http://www.iveo.se">Iveo</a><br></b>
							<i>Strengths:</i> The website is well designed and laid out. The design looks very modern and simple. It is pleasing to look at.<br>
							<i>Weaknesses:</i> The site has poor English, as it is a Swedish company. There is also fairly minimal interactivy.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b><a href="http://brooklynunited.com/">Brooklyn United</a><br></b>
							<i>Strengths:</i> This is a well designed, interactive website. They have a clear goal to promote their design firm, and it is obvious that there is a quality design present. Very modern and good-looking.<br>
							<i>Weaknesses</i> The site does not degrade well to slow connections. It also has limited scaling down to mobile platforms.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>27 April</h2>
					<p>After the terrible floppy accident of sometime after April 16th, many of the journal entries were lost. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>30 April</h2>
					<p>
						Still attempting to recover the information lost in the floppy magnet disaster of 2015, I have recreated my bootstrapped version of rock/paper/scissors almost entirely. The code works for the most part, save for the enemy choice icon not showing up at all. It otherwise functions perfectly.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>4 May</h2>
					<p>
						My rock paper scissors web site was uploaded to GitHub class repository. The entire site is functional at this point. I have yet to upload my bootstrap grid test project, as there are small changes that need be made.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>7 May</h2>
					<p>
						Today I started work on the color scheme and navigation bar updates of the rock paper scissors bootstrapped website. After I finish the green color scheme, I will upload the new version to Git. The new version has different pictures as well.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>11 May</h2>
					<p>
						Looking at the rubric for making the final project. My home page is currently very simple, reading "I MAKE REALLY GOOD WEB SITES SAY THEY ARE GOOD OR GET THE HECK OUT". I hope to make improvements to the site and give it a modern design before I turn it in. I am still going with the current idea of varying colors of green for a color scheme.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>18 May</h2>
					<p>
						Worked more on linking my final homepage to be more cohesive overall. The homepage currently has a navigation bar to link rock paper scissors, along with all of the other pages.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="journalEntry">
					<h2>19 May</h2>
					<p>
						Added an "about me" section to the website. The about me section contains a highly infomative biography that accurately summarizes my character. My website is almost done, I only need to add a biography section and console output to the rock/paper/scissors game.
