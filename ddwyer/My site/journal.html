				<h2>Journal 7 Thursday April 16 </h2>

				<p>Today I worked on my rock paper scissors game and I worked on finishing the grid challenge. I'm working on making the rock paper scissors game print pictures to the screen.  I went to <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a>, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">Xbox.com</a>, and <a href="http://tomclancy-thedivision.ubi.com/game/en-US/home/">tomclancy-thedivision.ubi.com.</a> Apples website flowed very nicely and the only remotely bad thing I saw was there was a lot of white. Xboxs website did a very good job of seperating content and making it look good, but there was a lot of content on screen. The tom clancey website was really cool in the way it used images but, it was kinda jumpy.</p>
