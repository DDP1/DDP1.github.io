   			<h3>May 4th, 2015</h3>

    		<p class="text">Added grid practice to github and now im updating my journal and then after that im thinking of copying my rock paper scissors game after a little edit then adding it to this to make it full then sooner or later making all of these pages responsive and adding forms to the about page I believe..But im not sure how that will go and what it will look like.</p>

   			<h3>May 5th, 2015</h3>
 
   			<p class="text">It's Cinco de mayo woop. Also today I am working on my rock paper scissor game in which I'm trying to make it responsive while making sure it all stays in order which for some reason its not working well.</p>

   		 	<h3>May 7th, 2015</h3>

   		 	<p class="text">Working on the final project and mostly today working on the nav bar.. Also making the whole site responsive and I'm thinking about dividing up the journal entries and making them have their own sections by month I think its a good use for the dropdown menu and I think it will work very nicely to show all the entries and its also making it neater.</p>

  		</div>


  		<div class="entry">
   			<h3>May 11th, 2015</h3>

   			<p class="text">Worked more on my site by making it look a bit neater and copying my game over to add to the website so far so good!</p>

 		<div class="entry">
  			<h3>May 12th, 2015</h3>

   			<p class="text">Learned about forms today and I'm thinking about what I should put on my site what questions to ask and such.</p>

 		<div class="entry">
   			<h3>May 14th, 2015</h3>

   		<p class="text">Continued work on my final project website I still need to add in forms which today I just made the home page and button responsive to the site but I havent added the forms yet...Not sure if I should just have it link to another page or figure out a way to have it have its own popup window. Ill work more on forms on monday and tuesday.I have less time than others to work on it so I'm gonna have to work fast.Also going to have to copy these over at the last minute or just edit this from the actual site which sounds like a better idea.</p>

   			<h3>May 18th, 2015</h3>

    		<p class="text">Sub today so I just worked on adding all my journal entries and making the website match with the rest of the pages.Made them all match the background color of the rock,paper,scissors game with a light header for all of them.Working on the final project and making sure all my files link up correctly and they are all responsive. Also getting all my web journals in check and making sure I make a June entry before I go. Have to look up more on forms because thats pretty much all I have left to do (besides web journals) and that needs to look nice and work. My dates got messes up so hopefully this day was right it may or may not be but I'm just gonna keep going.</p>

			<h3>May 19th, 2015</h3>

   			<p class="text">Worked on setting up my forms which as I look at it now it looks pretty good I think making it the way I did looks the nicest and also today we learned more about DOM the document object model and took a quiz on that and watched some videos on that. Most of my time will be today and next class is making sure the site is running well and everything responds to everything and also editing my forms to add some more things to it if needed. It will mostly be a check up on everything before its turned in and I graduate. Im a little worried that the what I made my final folder wont work with github and I hope I wont have extra work that I didnt even know about..that wouldnt be do good.</p>
