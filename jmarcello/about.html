		<p id="about">Hello, my name is JP! I'm an 18 year old in Portland, Oregon. I will soon graduate from Franklin High School in the class of 2015. I have a love for many things, the first of whcih is Video Games. I love to play tons of games on my computer, and on my Xbox. I will even begin attending Neumont University in the fall, to study to earn my Bachelors Degree in Programming and Game design. I also love to watch YouTube videos. Mostly I love to watch a Let's Player named Markiplier, but I do watch other videos too. I'm very involved in theater, and I love to perform on stage. I've been in quite a few productions, including Shakespeare performances, and Musicals like The Wizard of Oz, The Sound of Music, and Footloose.</p>
