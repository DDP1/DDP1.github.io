	<h4>2/ 17/ 15</h4>
	<p class="text-responsive"> Today, I practiced using some basic Javacript commands, like console log, alert and prompt through the screen casts my teacher provided on Moodle. I also learned a bit about naming variable as well as what variables are. Variables are defined as containers that store data values, which often relates to basic algebra in its use to hold values. I also learned about numbers in Javascript, which can be used with decimals and are often used in variables. Unlike many programming languages, Javascript doesn't define different types of numbers. Strings are used to store characters that can be expressed in the console in in the site itself, and is always accomodated by quotes, which can be single or douvle spaced. I am excited to use this new langauge, and maybe even incorporate it into the project I made in Semester one.</p>

	<p class="text-responsive">Today was a shorter class, like every thursday, and I just worked on modifying the Javascript rainbow practice an changing the colors as well as researching some Javascript. I also found how this could be done with css, though it looked like a much more text-heavy process. We were introduced to a moodle forum for our class that we can use to ask and find questiosn. I may not use this local forum too much, but it may be useful from time to time.</p>

	<p class="text-responsive"> It was a skinny monday today, and We were introduced to this weeks screencasts on moodle, which focused on arrays(varables containing multiple values). Our job in the practice is to create a series of prompts within an array that the user can type in, which will affect the values(strings of the array, and what appears in the console and the site. I got started with this practice and it was a bit confusing. Im hoping to finish and practice more next class.</p>

We practice using a few math elements, and a bit of practice with variables using a glue-in "cheatsheet". I plan to work with loops tonight and tomorrow as I await the new work for the week!</p>

I looked at three different sites: <a href="http://parachutemontreal.ca/fr/?gclid=CJLVufOb-8QCFRSPfgodMwYASg">Parachute Monreal</a>,<a href="http://www.bialystok.pl/127-wschodzacy-bialystok/default.aspx">Wschedzacy Blatystok</a> (obviously a foreign site) and <a href="http://kurokawawonderland.jp/">Kurekawa Wonderland</a>. All of these sites were visually appealing, and each used specific style that I liked. Parachute montreal had alot of short, looping videos, which worked well, but didnt flow as well as I would have liked. The foreign site used a rally cool pictre that cycled through day and night, but it was a bit laggy. The last site, Kureka Wonderland, used a circular scroll bar for the video that introduces you to the site, and it can change into different shapes like a heart, but like the videos in parachute montreal, isnt extremely responsive.</p>

I know it a strange situation , because after all, I am sitting there writing page after page, and it probably seems like im using the time wisely, but i also understand that this is your class time (mine really) and that you can definitely asuume the value I take in your class over others. I assure you that any work I am not getting done in class will be done outside of class, and I'm sure you aren't very worried about me, because you know that I do my work, and that it's more than just about my grades, it's how I'm treating you as another perosn, and recognizing that this is time for me to focus on things you like to teach. Again, I'm sorry that I sometimes take time out to focus on other classes, even if it seems like it's okay to do so, because it likely will put you in the akward situation of "should I ask him about doing his work on the computer? I see that he is working on an Ap class, maybe thats more important." The exam is one week form today, and I'm glad it will all be over soon. </p>

Several things, like our scratch games and the javascript project #1 (playgrounds project), are additional things that could be implemented as well. It's basically one great big copy-paste project, but we all still need to create a consistent color theme alongside bootrapiing everything. Adding additional hover colors and colorchanges are all highly reccomeneded. I'm just not looking forward to deleting so much hard work in CSS for Bootstrap! </p>

So I just worked on getting the forms into the bootstrap modals, and enlisted the help of my dad with a bit of the JavaScript, so "bro-points" definitely go out to him. The project is now in a completed state, essentially. The checjlist for tomorrow would just to be giving everything a qucik brush ovr as well as addng some comments to most everything.</p>

	<p class="text-responsive"> So I'm just adding the finishing comments and such to my site before submitting it. I'll be doing this over the weeked as well as in class. As well as this I also want to add something that sort of "reacts" to my rps game. I was thinking either a changing font colot or an image, or maybe both. I'll definitely work on that over the weekend.</p>
