    <h1>THE HISTORY OF FOOTBALL</h1>

    <div  class="paragraph">

     <p>American football emerged from the European game of Rugby in 1879. Walter Camp, a player and coach of Yale University, is recognized as "The Father Of American Football" as the early rules of the game was instituted by him. However, previous to that, the students of Princeton were already playing a game called "Ballown". It was about fisting the ball and then using their feet to advance the ball past their opponents. There were no hard and fast rules that applied and could be stated as the easiest form of football at it's early times. However, the physical aspect of the game was immense and often it turned violent.</p>

This game was so much physical that the day it was played was often mentioned as<a href="http://www.footballnation.com/content/monday-bloody-monday-nine-nfl-head-coaches-and-gms-fired/20521/"> "bloody Monday"</a>. The year 1865 was very important for American Football. The Civil War had ended and football started gaining popularity in the colleges. It was in this year that some basic rules for the game were established and the game got its patent for the first time.In 1873, the Intercollegiate Football Association was formed by the representatives of Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, and Yale. Till then, the increasingly popular game was being played with many different rules. The association brought into effect the first set of rules of intercollegiate football which allowed fifteen players in each team. However, it was Walter Camp, a coach at Yale, who began the final process of evolution from rugby like game to what we know today as the American Football. The number of players was reduced to eleven and the standard size of the field was set to hundred and ten yards. A little later downs were introduced and tackling below the belt was legalized.
