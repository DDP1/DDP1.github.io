    <div class="paragraph">

     <p>Walter Camp was born April 17, 1859, in New Haven, Connecticut. He attended Yale from 1876 to 1882, where he studied medicine and business. Walter Camp was an author, athletic director, chairman of the board of the New Haven Clock Company, and director of the Peck Brothers Company. He was general athletic director and head advisory football coach at Yale University from 1888-1914, and chairman of the Yale football committee from 1888-1912. Camp played football at Yale and helped evolve the rules of the game away from Rugby and Soccer rules into the rules of American Football as we know them today.

      <p>Walter camp served on the rules committee from his college days up until his death. Rules such as legalization of the forward pass led to ball redesign and a more open style of play. The brutal, rough mass, plays which caused so much injury were prohibited by the rules committee along with locking of the arms by teammates. During his time on the rules committee Camp was also effective in helping the game time to be shortened to sixty minutes, as well as the development of the neutral zone in the history of football. The neutral zone separates the teams by one length of the ball before each play begins. As leader of the American Football Rules Committee, Walter Camp provided the leadership necessary to create a system of skill and training which outweighed the original brutality that was a part of the game, combining physical force with rules and game play to create a much beloved American sport that is big business today, as well as big entertainment for fans.
