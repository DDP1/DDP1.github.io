			<p>Yesterday I looked and the Xbox website and thought it looked good but needed more color and animations but overall it had a good feel to it and it was very organized. I also looked at the Apple website and thought it had a lot of great animations and was very organized but didnt have much color to look at. I also looked and Neumont university website and it looked great all around! it was helpful pleasent to look at and had great animations!</p>

			<h2>May 28th</h2>
			<p>Today I have almost completed this final project for this class. I feel that I am slowly getting ahold of the information that is given to me and I feel that I will have this project done on time with maybe a little help but not much. I still need to work on my forms because I still have no clue how to do it and I plan to come in next Monday after school to get it completed.</p>
