			<h2>A little bit about me!!</h2>
			<p>My name is Cullyn Smith and I am the author of this website! I go to Franklin High School and I am a Senior!! Sadly I will be graduating from here in just two more weeks but while I am here I am going to make the most of it while I can. I am excited and very scared to move on from High School but I know that I will be moving on to bigger and better things. Over my time at Franklin I have been involved in many different activities including the schools spring musical "Footloose"! I have also joined many clubs including one I made called "PIA" which was to bring any students who felt they had nowhere to go or no friends a place to call home and feel safe. I have been fortunate to have been able to make many friends while going here and I hope to keep them all for many many years to come.</p>
