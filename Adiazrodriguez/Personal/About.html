		<h2> About Me </H2>
			<p> Hi my name is Alex, I am 15 years old and this is my website.  I found Youtube back in 2009 and when i got on, I fell in love with the site.  I loved watching all of the people on Youtube play all of these different types of video games.  In Fact, if I never watched Youtube I would have never found any of the games I play today.  I started uploading Youtube videos a couple of years later and since then I have started uploading higher quality videos, and have started live streaming.  If you want more information about my Youtube and Twitch channels then read the passages below.</P>
			
		<H2> About my Youtube Channel </H2>
			<p> I started my <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RandmepicProductions/videos">Youtube channel</a> back in 2013 so it is a fairly new channel.  Right now I have uploaded a variety of games and plan to upload more.  I have uploaded Call of Duty, Titanfall, NBA 2K, and League of Legends.  I plan to upload destiny gameplay, GTA 5, Minecraft, and Call of Duty Advanced Warfare once it comes out.  As of September 16th, 2014 I have a total of 18 subscribers.  I would appreciate it if you could check out my <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RandmepicProductions/videos"> Youtube channel </a> and show you friends too.  I hope you enjoy the content. </P>

		<H2> About my Twitch Channel </H2>
			<p> I started my <a class="links" href="http://www.twitch.tv/randomepicdude">Twitch channel</a> in the Summer of 2014.  I am a fairly new streamer so I do not know everything but I am getting myself used to streaming.  I stream whenever I can so I stream almost every day, even if I can for only 2 or 3 hours.  The games I have streamed so far are League of Legends, minecraft and Call of Duty.  I hope to stream more games as I buy them but at the moment I am able to stream games on my PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.  As of September 16, 2014 I have a total of 8 followers.  I would appreciate it if you could drop by and check out the stream and bring your friends too.  I hope you enjoy the stream.
