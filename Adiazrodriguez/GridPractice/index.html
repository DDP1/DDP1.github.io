      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">"Tunak Tunak Tun" (Punjabi: ਤੁਣਕ ਤੁਣਕ ਤੁਣ) or simply "Tunak", is a bhangra/pop love song by Indian artist Daler Mehndi released in 1998. At the time, critics complained that Mehndi's music was only popular due to his videos that featured beautiful women dancing.[1] Mehndi's response was to create a video that featured only himself. The song and video were successes in India. It also became an international internet meme.[2] As of April 2012, all the uploads of the song have been viewed over 7.1 million times collectively on YouTube, the highest viewed one having over 4 million views.  The music video was the first made in India using bluescreen technology,[1] which allowed the singer to superimpose his image over various computer-generated backgrounds such as desert and mountain landscapes and St. Basil's Cathedral.</div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">"Chacarron Macarron" (usually shortened to "Chacarron") is a hit song by Panamanian artists Rodney Clark ('El Chombo') and Andy De La Cruz (also known as Andy Val Gourmet). Rodney is best known for Lorna's 2003 hit "Papi Chulo".The song has gained popularity on the Internet because of its nonsensical lyrics (which are nothing but gibberish consisting of various onomatopoeic sounds, such as the "uale" noise, earning him the nickname of "El Mudo") and music video, which has seen it being used in numerous viral videos online. A similar song, "Chacarron Macarron", appeared as the first track of Yahari's album Las + Bailables de .... Yahari.[1]It is one of the current at bat songs of Toronto Blue Jays shortstop José Reyes, Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman Andy Marte, Arizona Diamondbacks Catcher Miguel Montero, who also used it in 2007, and Texas Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus.The song contains a sample from "The Breaks" by Kurtis Blow.[2]</div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">"Cha Cha Slide" is a song by American artist DJ Casper (Willie Perry aka Mr. C the Slide Man), often played at dance clubs, school dances/proms, parties, ice and roller skating rinks, bar mitzvahs and weddings in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the song reached number one in March 2004.[2]</div>
