                        <p>Last Class we viewed websites to determine what styles they used and how their website supported mobile platforms.  I viwed The <a class="links" href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">league of legends website</a>, <a class="links" href="twitch.tv">Twitch.tv</a> and the <a class="links" href="http://www.microsoft.com/">microsoft website</a>.  Each had their goods and their bads.  Twitch contained a simple solor scheme of black white and purple and opted for a simple design that looks like it was for mobile.  THe way it optomized for mobile was really good and it was an easy to navigate site.  The league of legends site contained a very dark atmosphere and had a dynamic background that changes with the image displayed at the top of the page.  The website looked outdated but diplayed all recent information in a clear manner.  The microsoft site had a very professional look to iand had a simple scheme of white and grey.  It contained a clean look but fell short when the mobile version was intergrated.  There was no optimization for a phone other than the front page.  </p>
