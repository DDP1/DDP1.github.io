			which had alot of videos and pictures, and the site was also mobile friendly. But, there wasn't much content.</p>

			<p>Website number 3, <a href="http://www.travelbelize.org/">http://www.travelbelize.org/</a>, had lots of pictures.  These pictures were different shapes and sizes and appeared in an order instead of all at once.</p>
