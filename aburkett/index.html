    <h4>The White Wolf and The Man in the Mirror</h4>

    <p>Long ago, there was a prince that fell ill. His younger brother believed in the tale of the Grateful Wolf, which he went to search for. The brother found a white wolf, who feared a hunter and agreed to help the prince for protection. The wolf promised to heal the prince, if they promised to save him from the hunter. After the brother and the prince agreed, the wolf tricked them by stealing the prince's body and the prince turned into the wolf.  The Prince-wolf had no choice but to run away from his home in fear of the hunter.  When he found a wizard that could help him, he was tricked again by getting a curse that bound him inside a mirror for eturnity.</p>
    <p>After a few thousand years, a girl appeared with a way to break the curse. Will she be able to save him?</p>
