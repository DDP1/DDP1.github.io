    <h3>What I learned today..</h3>

    <p>Today we made a cheat sheet for javascript, not sure if it will help or not. I understand how to do most but adding things on to it or well adding on to a string or alert prompt things still have to get better at that and also with loops next class I have to do the "while" part of it. </p>

    <h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

    <p>Today I learned more about arrays and different types of array methods and made a little comment section in my array folder so if I need it for later use I will have it in the comments. Also worked on other weeks I havent finished and got them done.</p>

    <h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

    <p>Today I worked on the while loop with a group and then after that took notes on how the while loop and a for loop worked. Then just did some practice with those two loops.</p>

    <h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

    <p>Today I worked on the javascript project which I havent decided what to put down for the theme of the whole thing or a color scheme which is apparently very necessary for the page to have. Sad, cant just do black and putple. Not much is going on other than working on the project.</p>

    <h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

    <p>Today I worked more on the project I think I will use favorite baby boy and girl names and have them put the names in and then have it generate some picture or something just have to figure out how the button works. Also find a way to put in a while loop.</p>

    <h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

    <p>Today I worked on my Javascript project mostly all I did was get a color scheme and start to make the div for the photo I will be using with the button that I also have to work out how that is going to work to reveal the photo. That is what I did today and also need to find a use for 'while' loops so I dont lose points for it in the grade...</p>

    <h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

    <p>Finished project, even though I didnt do the while loop I did everything else and did them well I mean the color scheme doe.. pretty cool and I got help on the button so that works well and it ties the whole thing together as a joke because a cat instead of a baby photo is funny.. or well I guess..</p>
