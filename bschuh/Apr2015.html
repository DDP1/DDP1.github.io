		<h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

		<p>Today we went online and looked up websites that we thought were cool and had little things about it that we liked. I like having drop down menus soo thats pretty much what I looked for and just a nice clean layout so I liked Roosterteeths drop menu for their store and Itunes site for how neat and clean it was.</p>

		<h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

		<p>One site I went to that I liked was the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-music-itu">Itunes</a> website I liked it because it was neat and organised. There wasnt anything special about the site I just liked its style and would probably use their navigation bar if anything.The next site was the <a href="http://roosterteeth.com/home.php">Rooster Teeth</a> website and I liked how they had drop menus thats what I would use for my own site maybe not exactly like theirs but similar.What I didnt like was how the content was in its own little box and it didnt stretch to the full page. They both look good on mobile too! And my last one was the <a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF"> Paletton</a> website, I just liked how you could change colors and how it can make backgrounds for you I would you it for if I needed to make some sort of painting site that needed a color wheel..This one however doesnt look so good on moblie because of all that colors and the wheel is has to generate so its understandable and it still looks nice.</p>

Also working on projects that I believe require us to have bootstrap but I'm not sure because it just says on the board and he hasnt said anything yet...Which I just checked that does have to have it. </p>

		<h3>What I learned Today..</h3>

		<p>Today we had a sub so I just worked a bit on the rock, paper, scissors project and looked into making this project bootstrapped and work with that.I have to work on the rows and col. to make them all be responsive and so far some are but they always have a problem where they will move a bit with the screen but after that it doesnt move, not sure of the problem with it yet but I will.</p>
